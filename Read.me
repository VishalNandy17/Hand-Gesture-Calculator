Hand Gesture Calculator

A Python-based hand gesture calculator utilizing OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition. This application allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations using hand gestures detected through a webcam.

Features
Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition: Detect and interpret gestures to input numbers and mathematical operators.
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and power operations.
Clear and Evaluate: Clear the current expression or evaluate it to display the result.
Interactive Interface: Displays the detected gesture and the ongoing calculation visually.

Gestures Supported
Gesture Operation
Fist - 0
Index finger - 1
Index + Middle - 2
Index + Middle + Ring - 3
All fingers - 5
Thumb only - +
Pinky only - (-)
Thumb + Index + Pinky - *
Thumb + Pinky - /
Index + Middle + Ring - . (decimal)
Index + Ring - =
Index + Ring + Pinky - C (clear)
Thumb + Index + Ring - ( (open parenthesis)
Thumb + Index + Ring + Pinky - ) (close parenthesis)
Thumb + Middle + Ring - âˆš (square root)

Requirements: 
Python 3.8+
OpenCV
MediaPipe
NumPy

Install Dependencies
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy

How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-calculator.git
cd hand-gesture-calculator

Run the script:
python main.py ( Use the supported hand gestures in front of your webcam to perform calculations) . Press ESC to exit the application.

Key Components
Gesture Recognition: Utilizes MediaPipe's Hand Landmark Model to extract hand landmarks and derive finger states and angles.
Gesture Interpretation: Maps recognized hand gestures to numerical inputs or mathematical operators.
Expression Evaluation: Constructs mathematical expressions and evaluates them using Python's eval() function.
Interface Drawing: Displays real-time feedback, including the detected gesture and the current expression.
